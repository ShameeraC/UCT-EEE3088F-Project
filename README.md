# EEE3088F Group 18 Project
This project is a group project for the course EEE3088F at UCT. The aim of the HAT we are designing is to detect light and move a motor or other device in the direction of the light.

# Directories:
This repo has the following subfolders, which provide a useful common structure for custom electronics projects: \
    * Documentation:â€ŠProject documentation (including submissions) and component datasheets are stored here.\
    * Firmware: Any software developed for the hat will be stored here.\
    * PCB: This includes all KiCad files (schematics, pcb, gerber files, footprints etc.). The main KiCad folder is here. \
    * Production: The gerber files, BOM, Budget, or anything required by JLCPCB will be stored here. \
    * Simulation: Any simulation files (eg SPICE) or design stage generated results (Eg matlab or excel) will be stored here.
